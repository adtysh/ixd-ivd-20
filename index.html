    <p style="text-align:justify; ">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is a governmental organisation responsible for the civilian space programme, as well as aeronautics and space research in the United States. The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics was replaced by NASA in 1958. (NACA). supporting the use of space science for peaceful purposes Since its founding, NASA has been in charge of the majority of US space exploration operations, including the Moon, Mars, Venus, other tiny bodies, mercury, and other plants.

    From 1988 to the present, NASA has spent a significant amount of money on numerous space initiatives and research.
    This comprehensive, annualised dataset enables for more accurate inflation adjustments and direct comparisons of past and current planetary exploration efforts by NASA. It also allows for the investigation of altering national priorities in space exploration, spending by destination, significant programme responsibilities, research, launch costs, and other topics.</p><br>

    <p>In general, the information is divided into three categories: summaries, missions, and fiscal years.</p>

    <br><br><b>Tabs that combine raw data are called summaries:</b><br><br>
    
    <li><strong style="color: #06BCC1">Mission Costs:</strong> a complete list of annual spending for all planetary scientific missions from 1988 to the present (inflation adjusted). <br><br></li>
    
    <li><strong style="color: #06BCC1">Budgetary Tenure of Planetary Science:</strong> total funding requested by the White House and actually spent by NASA during the program's history.
    These are weakly normalised in order to ensure accounting consistency by including launch costs for significant programmes at all times.</li><br>
    
    <li><strong style="color: #06BCC1"> History:</strong> the same data as the preceding sheet, but using NASA's New Start Index to compensate for inflation (NNSI).</li><br>
    
    <li><strong style="color: #06BCC1">Funding by Destination:</strong> total spending each year for important solar system destinations, adjusted for inflation. </li><br>
    
    <li><strong style="color: #06BCC1">Key Programs:</strong> budget totals for major planetary flight programmes, including Mariner, Discovery, New Frontiers, Mars Exploration Program, and others, by year since the 1990s. </li><br><br>
    
    <p>Comparisons of destination and total funding for the planetary science decadal survey periods of 2013-2022, 2003-2012, and analogous periods dating back to the 1960s.<br><br>
    
    Mission tab contains every NASA planetary research mission has extensive annual budget tabs that break down costs by formulation, development, operations, and launch.
    
    <br><br>Fiscal year tab contains the total planetary science division programme funds, both those requested by the White House and those finally obligated by NASA. This is the raw data that was utilised to create the majority of the other sheets in this collection, and it closely matches the actual accounting provided in each year's budget estimates.

    <p style="text-align:justify; "><strong style="color: #06BCC1; font-size: 24px">Conclusion</strong><br><br>The reported data may differ slightly from outlays, which is when the money really moved out the door, because this dataset is based on publicly-reported commitments, which are contracted amounts that can be spent across a multi-year time frame. Unexpected mission-ending occurrences may also have an influence on stated responsibilities, allowing cash to be diverted to other projects or remain unutilized. The duties, on the other hand, are generally in line with NASA's declared mission expenditures.<br><br>

    Cost data from fiscal years 1959 to 1997 and from 2002 onwards comes from NASA's public budget projections presented to Congress, which were digitised by the Historical Reference Collection at NASA Headquarters.<br><br>
      
    Total "actuals" for space science programmes from fiscal years 1997 to 2001 are based on data presented by Jason Callahan at the AAS 45th Meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences in Denver, Colorado, in his paper "Budgeting for Exploration: History and Political Economy in Space Science 1959-2010." 7th of October, 2013.<br><br>
      
    Important mission events and dates are from : Beyond Earth: A Chronicle of Deep Space Exploration, 1958-2016, edited by Asif Siddiqi and released by the NASA History Program Office in 2018.</p><br>
